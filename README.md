# Graduation Project
This repository contains the pipeline for the creation of a nework based AI model that can predict new biological concepts (use case here is diseases and nutrients/metabolites) relations from literature data.


## Data
The data for this project was obtained from KMAP (Knowledge Map). It is a database which contains millions of biological relations, 
that were obtained from automatic text mining of the scientific literature. 
KMAP is the proprietary knowledge base of TenWise. You can find more information on KMAP at https://apimlqv2.tenwiseservice.nl/html/
